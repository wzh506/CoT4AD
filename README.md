<!-- ## Introduction -->


End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving methods still struggle to make correct decisions in interactive closed-loop evaluation due to limited causal reasoning capability. Current methods attempt to leverage the powerful understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to resolve this dilemma.  However, the problem is still open that few VLMs for E2E methods perform well in the closed-loop evaluation due to the gap between the semantic reasoning space and the purely numerical trajectory output in the action space. To tackle this issue, we propose **ORION**, a h**O**listic E2E autonomous d**R**iving framework by v**I**sion-language instructed acti**ON** generation.
ORION uniquely combines a QT-Former to aggregate long-term history context, a Large Language Model (LLM) for driving scenario reasoning, and a generative planner for precision trajectory prediction. ORION further aligns the reasoning space and the action space to implement a unified E2E optimization for both visual question-answering (VQA) and planning tasks. Our method achieves an impressive closed-loop performance of 77.74 Driving Score (DS) and 54.62\% Success Rate (SR) on the challenge Bench2Drive datasets, which outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin of 14.28 DS and 19.61\% SR.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/xiaomi-mlab/Orion.git
cd ./ORION
conda create -n orion python=3.8 -y
conda activate orion
pip install torch==2.4.1+cu118 torchvision==0.19.1+cu118 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -v -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


## Preperation
You can refer to [here](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2DriveZoo/blob/uniad/vad/docs/DATA_PREP.md) to prepare the Bench2drive dataset.

ORION uses the pretrained [2D llm weights](https://huggingface.co/exiawsh/pretrain_qformer/) and [vision encoder + projector weights](https://github.com/NVlabs/OmniDrive/releases/download/v1.0/eva02_petr_proj.pth) provided by [Omnidrive](https://github.com/NVlabs/OmniDrive/tree/main)
```
cd /path/to/OmniDrive
mkdir ckpts
```
The vision encoder + projector weights are extracted from ckpts/pretrain_qformer/, which is pretrained by using llava data.


## Open-loop evaluation

You can perform an open-loop evaluation of ORION with the following command

``` 
./adzoo/orion/orion_dist_eval.sh adzoo/orion/configs/orion_stage3.py [--PATH_CHECKPOINTS] 1
```

You also can perform a CoT inference of ORION with (this might be quite slow)

``` 
./adzoo/orion/orion_dist_eval.sh adzoo/orion/configs/orion_stage3_cot.py [--PATH_CHECKPOINTS] 1
```

We recommend inference for ORION on an NVIDIA A100 or other GPUs with more than **32GB** of memory (inference in fp32, as default).


## Close-loop evaluation

You can refer to [here](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive) to clone Bench2Drive evaluation tools and prepare CARLA for it.

Follow [here](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive?tab=readme-ov-file#eval-tools) to use evaluation tools of Bench2Drive.

Note that you may first verify the correctness of the team agent， you need to set GPU_RANK, TEAM_AGENT, TEAM_CONFIG in the eval scripts.

You can set as following for close-loop evaluation 
```
TEAM_CONFIG=adzoo/orion/configs/orion_stage3_agent.py+[CHECKPOINT_PATH]
```
